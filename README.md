**Overview**

The Raspberry Pi is one of the main components of this project. We used the Raspberry Pi for the functioning of the meditator station. RFID scanner and 16x2 LCD display are two main components connected to the Raspberry Pi. The meditator station gives instructions to the students to take the portable meditator from the station for their use.
